## Natural Language Processing Leveraging the Watson Alchemy API

### Created by: Kevin McGovern

### Project Objectives:
    - Create a functional webapp
    - Implement an external API (Alchemy Language)
    - Deploy webapp to internet via Heroku
    - Minimize expense of HTTP requests using AJAX

### Minimum Viable Product Outline
    - Users can register/login/logout
    - Users must be logged in to use website
    - Users enter text, webapp queries API and returns the sentiment/score of comments directed towards particular nouns
    - User posts/responses are automatically stored in database
    - User can delete posts/reponses from database

### Stretch Goals
    - Return on text offers general guidance on improving message (e.g. "You're directing a lot of anger towards Ralph. You should not send this message to them")
    - Webapp offers potential replacement text for phrases where syntax is too negative
